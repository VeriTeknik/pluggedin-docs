## The Crossroads for AI Data Exchanges

Plugged.in is a comprehensive platform for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities. It provides a unified interface for discovering, configuring, and utilizing AI tools across multiple MCP servers while leveraging your own documents as context.
