# RAG Knowledge Base Tutorial

Build a powerful knowledge base using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance your AI interactions with contextual information.

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system in Plugged.in allows you to create project-specific knowledge bases that can be queried by AI models through MCP servers. This enables AI assistants to access your documentation, notes, and other text content to provide more accurate and contextual responses.

### Key Features

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your RAG knowledge base, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plugged.in Account">
    An active account with at least one project created
  </Step>

  <Step title="API Key">
    A valid API key for authentication (available in Settings → API Keys)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Documents">
    Text-based documents you want to include in your knowledge base
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1: Enable RAG Features

First, ensure RAG features are enabled for your project:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Project Settings**
2. Enable the "RAG Features" toggle
3. Save your settings

<Note>
RAG features may require additional permissions or a specific subscription tier. Contact support if you don't see this option.
</Note>

## Step 2: Upload Documents

### Using the Web Interface

1. Go to **Library** in the sidebar
2. Click **Upload Documents**
3. Select your files (supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
4. Add optional metadata:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Tags
   - Category

### Using the API

```bash
curl -X POST https://plugged.in/api/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf" \
  -F "metadata={\"title\":\"My Document\",\"tags\":[\"tutorial\",\"rag\"]}"
```

### Supported File Types

| Format | Extensions | Max Size |
|--------|------------|----------|
| PDF | .pdf | 10 MB |
| Microsoft Word | .docx, .doc | 10 MB |
| Text | .txt | 5 MB |
| Markdown | .md, .mdx | 5 MB |
| HTML | .html, .htm | 5 MB |

## Step 3: Configure MCP Server

Add the Plugged.in RAG MCP server to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pluggedin-rag": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@pluggedin/pluggedin-mcp-proxy"],
      "env": {
        "PLUGGEDIN_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Query Your Knowledge Base

Once configured, the RAG system provides several tools for querying:

### Available Tools

#### `pluggedin_rag_query`
Search and retrieve relevant information from your knowledge base.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required): Your search query
- `max_results` (optional): Maximum number of results (default: 5)
- `threshold` (optional): Relevance threshold 0-1 (default: 0.7)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "pluggedin_rag_query",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "How to configure authentication?",
    "max_results": 3
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Managing Your Knowledge Base

### Update Documents

Documents can be updated through the web interface or API:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://plugged.in/api/documents/{document_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Updated Title",
    "content": "Updated content...",
    "metadata": {"version": "2.0"}
  }'
```

### Delete Documents

Remove documents when they're no longer needed:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://plugged.in/api/documents/{document_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Search Documents

Search your knowledge base programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST https://plugged.in/api/documents/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "authentication setup",
    "limit": 10,
    "filters": {
      "tags": ["security", "auth"]
    }
  }'
```

## Best Practices

## Advanced Features

### AI-Generated Documents

Plugged.in supports AI-generated documents with full attribution tracking:

```bash
curl -X POST https://plugged.in/api/documents/ai \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "API Documentation",
    "content": "# API Overview\n\n...",
    "metadata": {
      "model": {
        "name": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet",
        "provider": "Anthropic",
        "version": "3.5"
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Vector Search Configuration

Customize vector search behavior:

```json
{
  "search_config": {
    "embedding_model": "text-embedding-ada-002",
    "similarity_metric": "cosine",
    "reranking": true,
    "hybrid_search": true
  }
}
```

### Bulk Operations

Import multiple documents at once:

```bash
curl -X POST https://plugged.in/api/documents/bulk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "documents": [
      {"title": "Doc 1", "content": "..."},
      {"title": "Doc 2", "content": "..."}
    ]
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
Common issues and their solutions:
</Warning>

### Documents Not Appearing in Search

1. **Check indexing status**: Documents may take 1-2 minutes to index
2. **Verify file format**: Ensure documents are in supported formats
3. **Check file size**: Files over 10MB are rejected
4. **Review content**: Very short documents may not index well

### Low Relevance Scores

- Improve document quality with more descriptive content
- Use specific keywords that match likely queries
- Break complex topics into focused documents
- Consider adjusting the similarity threshold

### API Rate Limits

RAG operations have the following limits:
- Document uploads: 100 per hour
- Search queries: 1000 per hour
- AI document creation: 10 per hour
