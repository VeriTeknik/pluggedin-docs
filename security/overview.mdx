# Security Documentation

Plugged.in implements comprehensive security measures to protect your data and prevent various attack vectors. This document outlines our security features and best practices.

## Security Features

### 1. URL Validation and SSRF Prevention

The application implements comprehensive URL validation to prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

<Card title="Domain Allowlisting" icon="shield-check">
  - Only allows requests to explicitly trusted domains
  - Prevents requests to arbitrary external services
  - Configurable per environment
</Card>

<Card title="IP Address Blocking" icon="ban">
  **Blocks all private IPv4 ranges (RFC 1918):**
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 172.16.0.0/12
  - 192.168.0.0/16
  - 169.254.0.0/16 (link-local)
  - 127.0.0.0/8 (loopback)

  **Blocks IPv6 private/local addresses:**
  - ::1 (loopback)
  - fe80::/10 (link-local)
  - fc00::/7 (unique local)
  - ff00::/8 (multicast)
</Card>

### 2. Protocol Enforcement

- Only allows HTTP and HTTPS protocols
- Blocks potentially dangerous protocols: `file://`, `ftp://`, `javascript:`, `data:`

### 3. Credential Protection

- Prevents URLs with embedded credentials (username:password@)
- Protects against credential leakage
- Automatic credential stripping in shared configurations

### 4. Special Character Protection

- Blocks null bytes in URLs
- Prevents directory traversal attempts
- Path normalization and validation

## Usage Guidelines

### For External APIs

```typescript
import { validateExternalUrl } from '@/lib/url-validator';

// Validate before making request
const url = validateExternalUrl('https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo');
const response = await fetch(url.toString());
```

### For Internal Registry APIs

```typescript
import { validateInternalUrl } from '@/lib/url-validator';

// More restrictive validation for internal services
// Allows: registry.plugged.in, staging.plugged.in and their api subdomains
const url = validateInternalUrl('https://registry.plugged.in/v0/servers');
const response = await fetch(url.toString());
```

### For Development with Localhost

```typescript
// Localhost is automatically allowed in development (NODE_ENV=development)
const url = validateExternalUrl('http://localhost:8000');

// Or explicitly enable localhost in any environment
const url = validateExternalUrl('http://localhost:8000', {
  allowLocalhost: true
});
```

## Security Assumptions

### Trust Boundary

The allowed domains list defines our trust boundary. Only add domains that are:
- Under our control (registry.plugged.in, staging.plugged.in)
- Well-known, trusted third-party services (GitHub, npm, etc.)
- Required for application functionality

### Environment-based Security

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Production">
    - Strict domain allowlisting
    - No localhost access
    - Enhanced monitoring
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Development">
    - Localhost automatically allowed
    - Relaxed restrictions for testing
    - Debug logging enabled
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Staging">
    - Staging domains always allowed
    - Production-like security
    - Testing environment
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Defense in Depth

URL validation is one layer of defense. Additional layers include:
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Input validation at multiple levels
- Output encoding to prevent XSS

### Fail Secure

When validation fails, the request is blocked. No fallback or bypass mechanisms.

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage is provided in `tests/security/url-validator.test.ts`:
- SSRF prevention tests
- IPv4 and IPv6 validation
- Domain allowlisting
- Credential blocking
- Protocol validation
- Edge cases and attack vectors

Run security tests:
```bash
pnpm test tests/security/url-validator.test.ts
```

## Monitoring and Logging

<Note>
Consider implementing:
1. **Security Telemetry**: Log blocked requests for security monitoring
2. **Rate Limiting**: Limit validation failures per IP to prevent abuse
3. **Alerting**: Alert on unusual patterns of blocked requests
</Note>

## Updating Allowed Domains

To add a new allowed domain:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Trustworthiness">
    Review the domain's trustworthiness and necessity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Configuration">
    Add to `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` in `lib/url-validator.ts`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document Reason">
    Document the reason for addition in code comments
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Tests">
    Update tests to cover the new domain
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consider Scope">
    Determine if it should be in `validateInternalUrl` allowed list
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Known Limitations

<Warning>
1. **DNS Rebinding**: URL validation happens before the request. DNS rebinding attacks that occur after validation are not prevented by this layer.
2. **Redirect Following**: The validator only checks the initial URL. Server-side redirects need additional handling.
3. **Time-of-Check vs Time-of-Use**: Domain resolution can change between validation and request execution.
</Warning>

## Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:

1. Block the affected domain/IP immediately
2. Review logs for exploitation attempts
3. Update validation rules
4. Deploy fix with urgency
5. Document in security changelog

## Regular Security Reviews

- Review allowed domains quarterly
- Update blocked IP ranges as new private ranges are allocated
- Monitor for new SSRF techniques and update defenses
- Keep dependencies updated for security patches

## Additional Security Features

### End-to-End Encryption (v2.2.0+)

- All sensitive MCP server configuration data encrypted at rest
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- Per-profile encryption keys
- Automatic encryption/decryption

### Rate Limiting

- Auth endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- API endpoints: 60 requests per minute
- Public endpoints: 100 requests per minute
- AI document creation: 10 requests per hour

### Input Validation

- Zod validation schemas for all server actions
- Sanitization of HTML/Markdown content
- Path traversal protection
- Content length validation
