# Sharing MCP Servers in Plugged.in

This document explains how MCP server sharing works in Plugged.in, focusing on security practices and how sensitive information is handled.

## Security Overview

When you share an MCP server in Plugged.in, we prioritize security by ensuring that sensitive information like credentials, API keys, and private URLs are never exposed to other users.

## What Information is Shared?

When you share a server, the following information is shared:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Shared Information" icon="share">
    - Server title and description
    - Server type (STDIO, SSE, or Streamable HTTP)
    - Basic command and arguments structure
    - URL structure (with credentials removed)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protected Information" icon="lock">
    - Passwords and API keys in database URLs
    - Environment variables containing secrets
    - Authentication tokens
    - Private API keys
    - Any other credentials
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Sanitization Works

When you share an MCP server, Plugged.in automatically performs these security measures:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Template Creation">
    We create a sanitized template of your server configuration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credential Removal">
    Any passwords in connection strings are replaced with placeholders
  </Step>
  <Step title="Environment Variable Protection">
    Sensitive environment variables are replaced with descriptive placeholders
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Key Protection">
    API keys in URLs or parameters are removed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example of Sanitization

<CodeGroup>
```text Original
postgresql://postgres:MySecretPassword123!@database.example.com:5432/my_database
```

```text Sanitized
postgresql://postgres:<YOUR_PASSWORD>@database.example.com:5432/my_database
```
</CodeGroup>

## When Importing Shared Servers

When someone imports a server you've shared:

1. **They receive the sanitized template** with placeholders
2. **They must provide their own credentials** to make the server work
3. **The template serves as a guide** for proper configuration
4. **A note indicates** that the server was imported from a shared template

<Note>
Imported servers are marked with a special indicator showing they came from a shared template, helping users understand they need to configure their own credentials.
</Note>

## Best Practices

Even with these protections in place, it's good practice to:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Before Sharing">
    Always review what you're sharing before making it public. Check the server configuration preview to ensure no sensitive data is visible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Information">
    Provide clear titles and descriptions to help others understand the purpose of the server and any specific requirements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add Setup Instructions">
    Consider adding setup instructions in the description if there are specific requirements or configuration steps needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test the Template">
    If possible, test importing your own shared server to verify the sanitization worked correctly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sharing Process

### Making a Server Public

1. Navigate to your MCP Servers page
2. Click on the server you want to share
3. Toggle the "Share" option
4. Review the sanitized configuration
5. Add a description for other users
6. Confirm sharing

### Discovering Shared Servers

Users can discover shared servers through:
- **Search Page**: Browse all publicly shared servers at `/search`
- **Search**: Find servers by name or description
- **Trending**: View popular servers based on usage
- **User Profiles**: See servers shared by specific users

## Privacy Considerations

<Info>
**Your privacy is protected:**
- Original configuration data never leaves your account
- Sanitization happens server-side before sharing
- You can unshare a server at any time
- Usage statistics are anonymous
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Credentials Not Working">
    If an imported server isn't working:
    - Verify you've replaced all placeholder values
    - Check environment variable names match
    - Ensure API keys are correctly formatted
    - Test connection strings separately
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Missing Configuration">
    Some servers may require additional setup:
    - Check the server description for requirements
    - Look for documentation links
    - Verify all dependencies are installed
    - Check for required environment variables
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
